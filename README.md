Project Objective: Follow the Kimball Lifecycle to design and develop a public, cloud-based Data Warehouse with a functioning BI Applications

Project Tools:
The tools used to build this Data Warehouse were: (change this to make applicable to your project)
1. For data integration - python
2. For data warehousing - Google BigQuery
3. For Business Intelligence - Tableau

## Kimball Lifecycle Project Stages

### Project Planning

Motivation for project:
To seize opportunities within the mobile app market that can have promising yields.

Description of the issues or opportunities the project will address:
The different factors of apps within the Google Play Store can be more thoroughly analyzed to uncover whether there are correlations that lead to the success of some apps.

Project Business or Organization Value:
High-level Business Initiative:

Determine whether there are specific factors that lead to the success of some apps.

BI Sponsors and Stakeholders (who will own this project?)

Game developer app agencies. 

Whatâ€™s the Business Value?

If we can determine whether there are certain factors that lead to success of some apps, then the game developer app agencies that are our stakeholders can tailor their development with these factors in mind, increasing the probability of success and profitability of these apps. 

How long will this take? How much will this cost?

3 months - the length of this course

We will be using Google BigQuery for cloud storage and future query. Our dataset is about 9MB for two datasets with the storage costs at $0.02/GB/month. Our estimated costs will be less than a dollar per month.
